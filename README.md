**Done By:** Alefiya Joharbhai Managori  
**Task Type:** SQL Practice  
**Objective:** To understand and implement basic data retrieval operations using `SELECT` statements in MySQL.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

This task involves practicing the use of SQL `SELECT` statements to:

- Retrieve all data from a table
- Fetch specific columns
- Filter records using conditions
- Use logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN`
- Sort results using `ORDER BY`

## 🗂️ Tables Used

The following sample tables were used for executing and testing queries:

- **User** – Stores user information such as ID, name, and email.
- **Product** – Contains product names, prices, and descriptions.
